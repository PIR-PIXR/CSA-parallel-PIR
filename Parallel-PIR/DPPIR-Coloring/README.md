# DP-PIR + Coloring

---
## Experimental setup
For simplicity, we ran our experiments on a local Ubuntu 22.04.1 environment (Intel Core i5-1035G1 CPU @1.00GHz√ó8, 15GiB System memory). We employed two servers and one client, which acted as multiple clients, following the same settings described in [DP-PIR](https://github.com/multiparty/DP-PIR/tree/usenix2022).

<strong> Figure 1.</strong> The computation time for DP-PIR and DP-PIR+Coloring, both online and offline, was evaluated from $n = 2^{10}$ to $n = 2^{16}$ while retrieving 6000 Merkle proofs privately.
