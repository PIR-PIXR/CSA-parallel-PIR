# DP-PIR + Coloring

---
## Experimental setup
For simplicity, we ran our experiments on a local Ubuntu 22.04.1 environment (Intel Core i5-1035G1 CPU @1.00GHz√ó8, 15GiB System memory). We employed two servers and one client, which acted as multiple clients, following the same settings described in [DP-PIR](https://github.com/multiparty/DP-PIR/tree/usenix2022).

<strong> Figure 1.</strong> The computation time for DP-PIR and DP-PIR+Coloring, both online and offline, was evaluated from $n = 2^{10}$ to $n = 2^{16}$ while retrieving 6000 Merkle proofs privately.

### Executing DP-PIR and DP-PIR+Coloring
      $ sudo sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=123289600
      $ sudo sysctl -w net.core.wmem_max=123289600
      $ cd /path/to/experiments/orchestrator
- #### On your local machine
  ##### Open the first terminal
      $ cd /path/to/experiments/orchestrator
      $ node main.js
  ##### Open the second terminal
      $ ./experiments/local.sh 2 1
  ##### Return to the first terminal
      $ load dpPIR
      
- #### On AWS
  Create EC2 instances on AWS. Ensure all the instances have TCP allow ports in the 0 to 65535 range. Connect all instances via SSH.
  ##### On the Servers side
      $ Copy pirmessage_server and data.json from your local machine to the Server
      $ Edit inbound rules on Security groups with type ALL TCP and add your client ip address
      $ ./pirmessage_server -port 3000
  ##### Open the Client side
      $ Copy pirmessage_client, encryption_parameters.bin, and servers_list.txt from your local machine to the Client
      $ Change the servers_list.txt with each Server IP address (e.g., 54.253.187.61:3000); database file name; and index i in the database for each line in the file
      $ cd /path/to/Parallel-SealPIR
      $ ./pirmessage_client
